My name is Yujia but I have also adopted the name Sabrina since it is more accessible to my friends and colleagues in the United States and Europe.

In May 2013, I graduated from the Smeal College of Business with an MBA in Supply Chain Management and Finance and I moved to Avon Lake to join Polyone in the Operational Excellence Leadership Development program. I am very happy to live in this lakefront community on the shores of Lake Erie and have the privilege to work at Polyone with such an awesome team.
