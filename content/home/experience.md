  My responsibilities in PolyOne Corporation, as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt include:<br/><br/>

* Act as the change agent to drive the culture change in the newly acquired businesses to be integrated with the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) paradigm in daily operations.
*   Lead Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Black Belt, Green Belt, Kaizen and JDI projects that span cross-functions to serve critical business need and achieve company’s four-pillar strategies in Operation Excellence, Commercial Excellence, Globalization and Specialization.

<br/>
Completed:

* Quality BOM (Bill of Material) Creation (BB): As the process in evaluating, deciding upon and creating a BOM lacked proper feasibility assessment, I led a cross-functional team that targeted to improve the process. The final outcome is the creation of CREAT (Customer Request Evaluation Automation Tool) which, upon receiving a customer request, generates clear, consistent and correct product match as well as plant capability identification. Estimated financial benefit for the first 12 months is $5.85 MM.
* RMRF Improvement (Kaizen): Designed the automated new RM (Raw Material) Request Form which complies with Food Contact Regulations (USA: FDA/FDM; EU: Resolution AP(89)1 for Pigments/Colorants, EU 10/2011; China: GB9685; SA_MERCOSUL countries: Mercosur, Anvisa), added new fields for information such as shelf life, proprietary component and 3TG Conflict Mineral, which serves to the company’s “No Surprise” commitment to customers and improves the process efficiency.

<br/>
Ongoing:

* Global Strategic Sourcing TPU/TPV 7-Step (BB): Systematically reviewed the global spending in the defined category, worked with suppliers in identifying potential innovation opportunities and contributed to establishing strategic partnership with selected suppliers. Estimated goal of the project is 10% CR of the addressable spending ($2.9MM annually).
PRP (PolyOne Reliability Program) which examines Preventative Maintenance consistently.
